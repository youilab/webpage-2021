At the time of writing, there were over 408,449 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 267,147 recovered patients, 45,361 deaths, a recovery ratio of 65.4%, and a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 11.1% in Mexico, the country with the second-highest CFR in the world."}],[{type:"text",text:"Standard contact-tracing and sentinel surveillance enabled monitoring COVID-19 cases during the pandemic Phases 1 and 2.

However, monitoring the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during Phase 3 in our country, with a population of 129 million inhabitants, has been hindered due to insufficient economic, technical, and human resources to conduct extensive field testing. The Mexican Ministry of Health has administered 0.4 tests per 1,000 inhabitants, a proportion 25 and 30 times lower than that in South Korea and the US, respectively. Since statistical modeling and quantitative prognostic assessments of the pandemic evolution based on limited testing data may result in inaccurate estimates, federal and state governments have explored cost-effective mHealth alternatives that support pandemic monitoring and intervention efforts.

Also, since obtaining COVID-19 field test results in most Mexican cities (including San Luis Potos\xed) is often delayed up to 7 to 10 days due to testing facilities limitations, counting with real-time COVID-19 self-assessment tool is a useful asset for generating new information leading to prompt decision making. For these reasons, we suggest that population-wide surveys\xb4 of signs, symptoms, and vulnerabilities administered through the CDS could be of use to identify potential infection hotspots and inform epidemiologists, public-health authorities, and policymakers\u2019 opportune intervention to fight the pandemics. The work conducted by Rossman et al. on population-wide surveys in Israel points to our suggestion. Counting with population-wide risk-assessments could also be useful to perform optimal resource allocation for field testing during a second SARS-Cov-19 infection wave, which may coincide with the event of stational influenza and dengue epidemic affecting San Luis Potos\xed. Once a vaccine becomes available, survey data could also provide useful information resource allocation techniques to guide optimal vaccination campaigns."}]]},{title:"WeNet: The Internet of US",image:"Assets/img/projects/WeNet.jpg",description:"WeNet is funded by the EU H2020 program and supported by reserchers from several countries.

Variability in exposure is related to an individual\u2019s location, activity, and behavior or preferences at a particular point in time, as well as pollutant emission rates and physical and chemical processes that affect pollutant concentrations. In general, three types of variability can be identified: a) spatial variability that can occur both at regional (macroscale) and local (microscale) levels; b) temporal variability, which refers to variations over time whether short or long term; and c) interindividual variability which can be either human characteristics and human behaviors/preferences.

Our descriptor is based on a multi-view approach of curvature features, consisting of the following steps: pose normalization of 3D models, local curvature descriptor calculation, construction of 3D shape descriptor using the multi-view approach and curvature maps, and dimensionality reduction by random projections. We generate two descriptors from two different paradigms: 1) handcrafted, wherein the descriptor is manually designed for object feature extraction, and directly passed on to the classifier and 2) machine learnt, in which the descriptor automatically learns the object features through a pretrained deep neural network model (VGG-16) for transfer learning and passed on to the classifier. These descriptors are applied to two different archaeological datasets: 1) non-public Mexican dataset, represented by a collection of 963 3D archaeological objects from the Templo Mayor Museum in M\xe9xico City that includes anthropomorphic sculptures, figurines, masks, ceramic vessels, and musical instruments; and 2) 3D pottery content-based retrieval benchmark dataset, consisting of 411 objects. Once the multi-view descriptors are obtained, we evaluate their effectiveness by using the following object classification schemes: $K$ -nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and structured support vector machine. Our object descriptors classification results are compared against five popular 3D descriptors in the literature, namely, rotation invariant spherical harmonic, histogram of spherical orientations, signature of histograms of orientations, symmetry descriptor, and reflective symmetry descriptor. Experimentally, we were able to verify that our machine learnt and handcrafted descriptors offer the best classification accuracy (20% better on average than comparative descriptors), independently of the classification methods. Our proposed descriptors are able to capture sufficient information to discern among different classes, concluding that it adequately characterizes the datasets.",url:"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8576529",doi:"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2886791"},{title:"Mi Casa es su Casa?

In this paper, we investigate how the impressions of outdoor urban spaces judged by online crowd annotators, compare with the impressions elicited by the local inhabitants, along six physical and psychological labels. We focus our study in a developing city where understanding and characterization of these socio - urban perceptions is of societal importance.We found statistically significant differences between the two population groups.Locals perceived places to be more dangerous and dirty, when compared with online crowd workers; while online annotators judged places to be more interesting in comparison to locals.Our results highlight the importance of the degree of familiarity with urban spaces and background knowledge while rating urban perceptions, which is lacking in some of the existing work in urban computing.",url:"https://www.idiap.ch/~gatica/publications/SantaniRuizGatica-icmr17.pdf",doi:"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3078971.3079022"},{title:"What TripAdvisor Can't Tell: Crowdsourcing Urban Impressions for Whole Cities",type:"book chapter",authors:["Gatica P\xe9rez, Daniel","Ruiz Correa, Salvador","Santani, Darshan","Biase, Alessia de","Ottaviano, Nancy","Zaza, Ornella"],book:"Digital Polis Symposium",year:2015,abstract:"In the context of a number of emerging opportunities for citizen participation in Latin America, we present an overview of the SenseCityVity project developed in Mexico.

Statistical analyses show that outdoor environments can be reliably assessed with respect to most urban dimensions by the observers of crowdsourced images. Furthermore, a cross-city statistical analysis shows that outdoor urban places in Guanajuato (a touristic, cultural heritage site) are perceived as more quiet, picturesque and interesting compared to places in Leon and Silao, which are commercial and industrial hubs, respectively. In contrast Silao, is perceived to have lower accessibility than Leon. Finally, we investigate whether the perceptions of urban environments vary across different times of the day and found that places in the evening are perceived as less happy, pleasant and preserved, when compared to the same place in the morning.

For this reason, there has been an increasing interest in conducting studies of human behavior from video blogs in affective and social computing. In this context, we consider the problem of mood and personality trait impression inference using verbal and nonverbal audio-visual features. Under a multi-label classification framework, we show that for both mood and personality trait binary label sets, not only the simultaneous inference of multiple labels is feasible, but also that classification accuracy increases moderately for several labels, compared to a single-label approach. The multi-label method we consider naturally exploits label correlations, which motivate our approach, and our results are consistent with models proposed in psychology to define human emotional states and personality. Our approach points to the automatic specification of co-occurring emotional states and personality, by inferring several labels at once, compared to single-label approaches. We also propose a new set of facial features, based on emotion valence from facial expressions, and analyze their suitability in the multi-label framework.",city:"New York, N.Y.",publisher:"Association for Computing Machinery",url:"https://repositorio.ipicyt.edu.mx/bitstream/handle/11627/5422/ProcNUM%282015%29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y",doi:"https://doi.org/10.1145/2836041.2836051"},{proceedingTitle:"The Young and the City: Crowdsourcing Urban Awareness in a Developing Country",type:"conference proceeding",authors:["Ruiz-Correa, Salvador","Santani, Darshan","Gatica P\xe9rez, Daniel"],conferenceName:"The First International Conference on IoT in Urban Space",year:2014,pages:"74-79",abstract:"We present a crowdsourcing study that investigates impressions of urban spaces by young inhabitants in a city in the developing world.
