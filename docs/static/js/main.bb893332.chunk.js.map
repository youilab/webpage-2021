For these reasons, we suggest that population-wide surveys´ of signs, symptoms, and vulnerabilities administered through the CDS could be of use to identify potential infection hotspots and inform epidemiologists, public-health authorities, and policymakers’ opportune intervention to fight the pandemics. The work conducted by Rossman et al. on population-wide surveys in Israel points to our suggestion. Counting with population-wide risk-assessments could also be useful to perform optimal resource allocation for field testing during a second SARS-Cov-19 infection wave, which may coincide with the event of stational influenza and dengue epidemic affecting San Luis Potosí.

In contrast, plumes from power plants and fires, although they are diluted, can still be identified for tens to thousands of kilometers.

In general, three types of variability can be identified: a) spatial variability that can occur both at regional (macroscale) and local (microscale) levels; b) temporal variability, which refers to variations over time whether short or long term; and c) interindividual variability which can be either human characteristics and human behaviors/preferences.

Our descriptor is based on a multi-view approach of curvature features, consisting of the following steps: pose normalization of 3D models, local curvature descriptor calculation, construction of 3D shape descriptor using the multi-view approach and curvature maps, and dimensionality reduction by random projections. We generate two descriptors from two different paradigms: 1) handcrafted, wherein the descriptor is manually designed for object feature extraction, and directly passed on to the classifier and 2) machine learnt, in which the descriptor automatically learns the object features through a pretrained deep neural network model (VGG-16) for transfer learning and passed on to the classifier. These descriptors are applied to two different archaeological datasets: 1) non-public Mexican dataset, represented by a collection of 963 3D archaeological objects from the Templo Mayor Museum in México City that includes anthropomorphic sculptures, figurines, masks, ceramic vessels, and musical instruments; and 2) 3D pottery content-based retrieval benchmark dataset, consisting of 411 objects. Once the multi-view descriptors are obtained, we evaluate their effectiveness by using the following object classification schemes: $K$ -nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and structured support vector machine. Our object descriptors classification results are compared against five popular 3D descriptors in the literature, namely, rotation invariant spherical harmonic, histogram of spherical orientations, signature of histograms of orientations, symmetry descriptor, and reflective symmetry descriptor. Experimentally, we were able to verify that our machine learnt and handcrafted descriptors offer the best classification accuracy (20% better on average than comparative descriptors), independently of the classification methods. Our proposed descriptors are able to capture sufficient information to discern among different classes, concluding that it adequately characterizes the datasets.\",\r\n    url: \"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8576529\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2886791\",\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    title:\r\n      \"Mi Casa es su Casa?

We found (1) that money is the main motivation for hosts to participate in Airbnb and that the earned money contributes significantly to the overall income of hosts; (2) that traditions that permeate the Mexican culture motivate hosts to engage in more personal hospitality experiences; (3) that Airbnb host practices lead to the creation of informal jobs that support the local community; and (4) that Airbnb local guests suggest that the lack of contextual information (i.e., the characteristics of the neighborhood where the accommodation is located) is a problem when renting in Mexico owing to safety issues.\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1145/3299817\",\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Looking South: Learning Urban Perception in Developing Cities\",\r\n    type: \"academic article\",\r\n    authors: [\r\n      \"Santani, Darshan\",\r\n      \"Ruiz-Correa, Salvador\",\r\n      \"Gatica Pérez, Daniel\",\r\n    ],\r\n    journal: \"ACM Transactions on Social Computing\",\r\n    year: 2018,\r\n    volume: 1,\r\n    issue: 3,\r\n    pages: \"1-23\",\r\n    abstract:\r\n      \"Mobile and social technologies are providing new opportunities to document, characterize, and gather impressions of urban environments.

Under a multi-label classification framework, we show that for both mood and personality trait binary label sets, not only the simultaneous inference of multiple labels is feasible, but also that classification accuracy increases moderately for several labels, compared to a single-label approach. The multi-label method we consider naturally exploits label correlations, which motivate our approach, and our results are consistent with models proposed in psychology to define human emotional states and personality. Our approach points to the automatic specification of co-occurring emotional states and personality, by inferring several labels at once, compared to single-label approaches.
