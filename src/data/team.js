I have an M.S. degree and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from UNAM and the University of Washington in Seattle, respectively. I have a great team of students and research associates. We work together in the development and implementation of multidisciplinary projects that aim to benefit the Mexican society. The You-i Lab is truly a team of people interested in the common good. \nMy areas of research include ubiquitous computing, machine learning, and computer vision applications. I am very lucky to have international colleges from whom I have learned a lot and enjoy developing projects with them.  I try to learn every day from each situation that life brings to me, and also try to apply the Buddhist knowledge I have received from my teachers. You can get in touch with me through myemail.",
