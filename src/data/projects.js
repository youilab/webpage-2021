Mexican health authorities reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Mexico City on February 27, 2020. The Phase 3 health emergency, declared by the Mexican Government on April 9, 2002, led to the implementation of preventive and control measures. These measures aimed to preserve lives, avoid saturation of health care facilities, and promote a voluntary home lockdown to protect the population from viral spreading through person-to-person contact. At the time of writing, there were over 408,449 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 267,147 recovered patients, 45,361 deaths, a recovery ratio of 65.4%, and a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 11.1% in Mexico, the country with the second-highest CFR in the world.",

However, monitoring the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during Phase 3 in our country, with a population of 129 million inhabitants, has been hindered due to insufficient economic, technical, and human resources to conduct extensive field testing. The Mexican Ministry of Health has administered 0.4 tests per 1,000 inhabitants, a proportion 25 and 30 times lower than that in South Korea and the US, respectively. Since statistical modeling and quantitative prognostic assessments of the pandemic evolution based on limited testing data may result in inaccurate estimates, federal and state governments have explored cost-effective mHealth alternatives that support pandemic monitoring and intervention efforts.

Due to the lack of a vaccine, early identification of these clusters is essential to disrupt the contagion chain, slow down disease spread, and prevent the collapse of healthcare facilities. For this reason, the Program for Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Respiratory Diseases implemented in San Luis Potosi city developed an accumulated risk approach, which brings into action an Epidemiological Intelligence task force focusing on characterizing population vulnerabilities, envisioning epidemiological scenarios, and developing tools supporting community risk assessment programs for prevention and timely intervention. To support the EI efforts, we developed and deployed the Health Sentinel. This mobile crowdsourcing platform allowed successful real-time data collection of geolocalized COVID-19 risk self-assessment surveys in a pilot study that reached 1,554 citizens´ contributions sent from representative areas of San Luis Potosi metropolitan area through the multipurpose CDS app, thus enabling practical COVID-19 community triage.

This information aims to help decrease the burden of healthcare facilities, prevent transmission, and ensure that those most in need get the right treatment given the state of the healthcare system in Sand Luis Potosi City.  Also, since obtaining COVID-19 field test results in most Mexican cities (including San Luis Potosí) is often delayed up to 7 to 10 days due to testing facilities limitations, counting with real-time COVID-19 self-assessment tool is a useful asset for generating new information leading to prompt decision making. For these reasons, we suggest that population-wide surveys´ of signs, symptoms, and vulnerabilities administered through the CDS could be of use to identify potential infection hotspots and inform epidemiologists, public-health authorities, and policymakers’ opportune intervention to fight the pandemics. The work conducted by Rossman et al. on population-wide surveys in Israel points to our suggestion. Counting with population-wide risk-assessments could also be useful to perform optimal resource allocation for field testing during a second SARS-Cov-19 infection wave, which may coincide with the event of stational influenza and dengue epidemic affecting San Luis Potosí. Once a vaccine becomes available, survey data could also provide useful information resource allocation techniques to guide optimal vaccination campaigns.",

About 91% of the world’s population lives in places where air quality exceeds WHO guideline limits. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 identified air pollution as a leading cause of global disease burden, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. The World Bank used this study as the basis for assessing the economic costs of pollution for the world’s economies. The costs of pollution are myriad, but the most damaging financial cost is the cost of premature mortality.

A typical urban area is affected by the surrounding regional background pollutants, which have evolved from various anthropogenic and natural processes.  Pollutant concentrations in a city increase due to the variety of urban emissions characteristic of populated areas. These concentrations led to elevated levels of primary and processed pollutants on spatial scales similar to the city’s size. On top of the urban mixture, locally elevated levels of freshly emitted pollutants occur over smaller scales (0 m to hundreds of meters). Specific locations that experience high air pollution levels include sites near and on roadways (including in vehicles), in fire plumes, and near chemical facilities. There are also locally large exposure gradients around factories and industrial complexes. In contrast, plumes from power plants and fires, although they are diluted, can still be identified for tens to thousands of kilometers. Secondary pollutants are found regionally with relatively smaller gradients. Dust impacts multiple scales; locally generated dust can have significant impacts locally, and dust storms can lead to intercontinental transport.",

Variability in exposure is related to an individual’s location, activity, and behavior or preferences at a particular point in time, as well as pollutant emission rates and physical and chemical processes that affect pollutant concentrations. In general, three types of variability can be identified: a) spatial variability that can occur both at regional (macroscale) and local (microscale) levels; b) temporal variability, which refers to variations over time whether short or long term; and c) interindividual variability which can be either human characteristics and human behaviors/preferences.  Individual locations, activities, or behaviors are not necessarily independent of variations in pollutant specific emissions or processes. For example, pollutant concentrations and personal activities to a particular location may vary according to weather conditions or on weekdays and weekends. ",

With the direct method, exposure levels are measured at the individual level, based on personal monitoring or using biological markers. With the indirect approach, exposure levels are usually estimated based on ambient measurements, exposure modeling, and survey. According to US EPA’s Guidelines for Exposure Assessment, exposure can be quantified in three different ways: 1) point-of-contact measurement or personal monitoring in which exposure can be measured at the point of contact (the external boundary of the body) while it is taking place, 2) reconstruction of internal exposure through the use of internal indicators (such as biomarkers) after the exposure has taken place and 3) the exposure scenario evaluation in which the exposure is estimated considering hypothetical but plausible scenarios to analyze the concentration and contact time, through the use of models.  A less standard approach of personal exposure considers: 1) individual point-fixed activities and uniform air quality approach; 2) trajectory-based and uniform air quality approach; 3) individual point-fixed activities and space-variable air quality approach; 4) trajectory-based and space-variable air quality approach.",
